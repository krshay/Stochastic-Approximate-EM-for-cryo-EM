# Stochastic Approximate EM for cryo-EM
Code for the paper "A Stochastic Approximate Expectation-Maximization for Structure Determination Directly from Cryo-EM Micrographs" by Shay Kreymer, Amit Singer, and Tamir Bendory.

The script main.m examplifies a reconstruction of a target volume directly from noisy simulated micrographs.
